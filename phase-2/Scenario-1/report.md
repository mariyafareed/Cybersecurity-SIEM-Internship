The Windows Event Logs room on TryHackMe offers a practical introduction to analyzing and understanding Windows logs using Event Viewer, wevtutil, and PowerShell’s Get-WinEvent. This room is highly relevant to the Phase 2 internship scenario focused on advanced SIEM log analysis using Sysmon, Winlogbeat, Filebeat, and Auditbeat. The room begins by walking you through how to navigate the Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational log to identify and filter Event IDs like 4104, which capture PowerShell script executions. One task guides you to extract specific PowerShell commands from log entries and understand their purpose—for example, identifying the use of whoami as part of a malicious script. Other tasks cover Event ID 800, which relates to pipeline execution details in the Windows PowerShell log, and guide you in retrieving the relevant Task Categories to better classify activity.

A significant portion of the room focuses on command-line log analysis using wevtutil, teaching how to extract and query log entries in text and XML formats. This is crucial for SOC analysts who must work efficiently on endpoints or integrate log queries into automated detection pipelines. Learners also practice using XPath filters and PowerShell queries, reinforcing skills that are directly applicable when hunting for IOCs or anomalous behavior in a SIEM. The room makes a clear distinction between using GUI tools like Event Viewer and more scalable CLI approaches using PowerShell, helping you decide which method suits which scenario.

By completing this room, you develop the ability to identify suspicious PowerShell execution, understand Task Categories like “Execute a Remote Command” and “Pipeline Execution Details,” and extract meaningful forensic evidence from Windows event logs. These skills are directly applicable to SIEM tasks such as analyzing Winlogbeat or Sysmon logs, constructing correlation rules, and investigating incidents based on log artifacts. The room lays a solid foundation for real-world detection engineering and threat hunting and serves as a perfect precursor to more advanced rooms like Elastic SIEM, Sysmon Fundamentals, and Threat Hunting. It equips you with essential log analysis skills and prepares you for detecting and responding to real adversary techniques in enterprise environments.
