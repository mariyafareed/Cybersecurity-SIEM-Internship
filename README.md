üöÄ Cybersecurity Internship at Srida IT Consulting & Services (OPC) Pvt Ltd

This repository serves as the culmination of my hands-on cybersecurity internship at Srida IT Consulting, under the mentorship of Rajendra Bodda. Over multiple phases, I explored real-world blue team scenarios, threat detection techniques, and advanced APT simulations. Each phase strengthened my understanding of how attackers operate and how defenders detect, respond, and document incidents.

üîç Internship Highlights Across All Phases

‚úÖ Phase 1: Blue Team Fundamentals & Log-Based Detection

Simulated brute force, malware, phishing, privilege escalation, and C2 traffic

Mapped attack behavior to Windows Event IDs using Sysmon and Winlogbeat

Used tools like Hydra, Nmap, Metasploit, VirusTotal, and Event Viewer

Learned SOC basics: SIEM correlation, IOC identification, detection mindset

‚úÖ Phase 2: SIEM Analysis, VA/PT & Incident Response

Performed SIEM log analysis with Filebeat, Auditbeat, and Sysmon logs

Ran vulnerability assessments using OpenVAS, Nikto, and Nmap

Simulated malware, reverse shells, and miner attacks for incident response

Documented incidents with clear timelines, affected systems, and recovery steps

‚úÖ Phase 3: Advanced Threat Hunting & APT Simulation

Recreated multi-stage APT-style attacks: fileless malware, DNS tunneling, lateral movement

Monitored attacker behavior with Sysmon, Suricata, and Zeek

Built ELK dashboards and wrote Sigma rules for custom detections

Developed confidence in detection engineering and proactive threat hunting

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Techniques Used
Sysmon, Winlogbeat, Zeek, Suricata, Metasploit, Mimikatz, OpenVAS, ELK Stack, Sigma, VirusTotal, PowerShell, Event Viewer

üß† Key Skills Gained

Windows log analysis (Event IDs, Sysmon telemetry)

Detection engineering with Sigma and ELK

Threat simulation and incident lifecycle (NIST/SANS)

Blue team mindset, real-world IOC correlation

Professional security documentation and reporting

üôè Acknowledgment
Thanks to Rajendra Bodda sir for the opportunity and mentorship in real-world threat detection, analysis, and incident response.
