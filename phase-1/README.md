# üö® Phase 1: Cybersecurity Internship ‚Äì Blue Team Detection & Log Analysis

This repository documents my hands-on work in **Phase 1 of the Cybersecurity Internship at Srida IT Consulting & Services (OPC) Pvt Ltd**, under the guidance of Rajendra Bodda.

In this phase, I worked through real-world SOC-level detection scenarios. Each scenario reflects practical blue team concepts like log analysis, exploitation detection, and endpoint behavior monitoring. I didn‚Äôt just simulate attacks‚ÄîI broke down **how they appear in logs**, what they mean from a defender‚Äôs perspective, and **how to detect them.**

### ‚úÖ Phase 1 Detection Scenarios

**Hint 1: Brute Force Detection**  
Simulated password brute-forcing via SMB using Hydra. Mapped failures to **Event ID 4625**, showing how login failures from the same IP are caught in a SIEM.

**Hint 2: Malware Detection**  
Analyzed malware using VirusTotal, PEStudio, and any.run. Explored file execution and process creation patterns logged via Sysmon (Event ID 1, 11).

**Hint 4: Suspicious Network Activity**  
Performed network reconnaissance using Nmap. Focused on detecting abnormal port scanning patterns with **Sysmon Event ID 3**.

**Hint 5: Phishing Email Detection**  
Reviewed phishing scenarios using TryHackMe labs. Parsed headers, evaluated attachments, and identified spoofed domains and malicious links.

**Hint 6: Unauthorized Access Attempt**  
Captured failed SMB login attempts using Metasploit. Explained detection via **Windows Security Log 4625**, and how defenders identify external probing.

**Hint 7: Suspicious File Download**  
Simulated a payload drop using Metasploit. Mapped file creation to **Event ID 11**, followed by execution via Event ID 1.

**Hint 8: Privilege Escalation**  
Gained SYSTEM-level access using exploitation techniques. Focused on identifying **Event ID 4672** and behaviors linked to privilege abuse.

**Hint 10: Command & Control (C2) Detection**  
Used Meterpreter reverse shells to simulate C2 traffic. Explained beaconing and remote control via outbound traffic on uncommon ports.
