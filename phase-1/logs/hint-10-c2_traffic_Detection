# Hint 10: Command and Control (C2) Traffic Detection

### ✅ Room
[TryHackMe: C2 101](https://tryhackme.com/room/c2101)

---

### 🎯 Objective
Understand how Command and Control (C2) infrastructure operates, and how to detect beaconing behavior, reverse shells, and persistence techniques used by attackers post-compromise.

---

### 🧪 Room Activities Performed

- Learned about C2 tools: **PowerShell Empire**, **Cobalt Strike**, and **custom Python agents**
- Observed how attackers use **reverse shells**, **beaconing intervals**, and **obfuscation**
- Studied simulated C2 channels and their network patterns

---

### 🔬 What Was Simulated / Analyzed

- Outbound communication from compromised host to C2 server (HTTP/S, DNS, or custom ports)
- C2 agent sending beacons at fixed intervals (e.g., every 60 seconds)
- Attackers issuing commands from C2 console to victim machine

---

### 🧠 What Would Be Logged (If Monitored)

| Event Type             | Event ID         | Description                           |
|------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Network Connection     | Sysmon ID 3      | Outbound traffic to rare port/IP      |
| Process Creation       | Sysmon ID 1      | Agent launched from unusual path      |
| PowerShell Logging     | Event ID 4104    | Encoded or remote commands executed   |
| Beaconing Detection    | Flow/Net logs    | Repeated intervals of outbound traffic|

### 🔍 Detection Tips (SIEM)

- Monitor repeated outbound connections to rare IPs
- Look for connections on high ports (e.g., 4444, 8080)
- Correlate **Sysmon ID 3** with known C2 infrastructure
- Look for **PowerShell Event ID 4104** with suspicious encoded scripts

---

### 💡 Learning Outcome

C2 channels are central to post-exploit
