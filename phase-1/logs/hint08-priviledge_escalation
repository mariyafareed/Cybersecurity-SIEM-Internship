### ðŸ§ª What Happened
After gaining initial access, the attacker upgraded the shell to Meterpreter and obtained **NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM** privileges, showing successful privilege escalation.

---

### ðŸ§  What Would Be Logged
- **Windows Event ID 4672** â€“ Special privileges assigned
- **Sysmon** would also show SYSTEM-level process activity
- **Optional**: Event ID 4720/4732 if user/group modified

### ðŸ’¡ Learning Outcome
Privilege escalation is a key attack stage. SYSTEM-level access gives attackers full control. Logs like 4672 and unusual privilege usage should be closely monitored.
