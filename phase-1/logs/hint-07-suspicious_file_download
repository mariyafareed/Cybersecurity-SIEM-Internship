### ðŸ§ª What Happened
The attacker used Metasploit to exploit MS17-010 and deliver a reverse TCP shell payload. This file was downloaded and executed on the victim machine, simulating malware delivery.

### ðŸ§  What Would Be Logged
- **Sysmon Event ID 11** â€“ File creation (payload dropped)
- **Sysmon Event ID 1** â€“ Process creation (payload executed)

### ðŸ’¡ Learning Outcome
Even legitimate tools like Metasploit simulate malicious behavior: dropping a payload and executing it remotely is a high-risk action. File creation logs can help defenders catch this early.
